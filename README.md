# Hello! 👋 

Welcome to my profile! My name is [Miguel], and I am a computer engineer. Here, I'll share a bit about my interests and areas of expertise.

## Bioinformatics 🧬

I am passionate about bioinformatics and how computing can be used to analyze and process large amounts of biological data. I am interested in learning more about DNA and RNA sequence analysis, as well as designing algorithms for the processing and analysis of biological data.

## Algorithms and Mathematics 🧮

I am enthusiastic about mathematics and algorithms, and I love designing and developing efficient and elegant algorithms to solve mathematical and computational problems. I enjoy keeping up with the latest advances in algorithm theory and am interested in exploring new areas such as quantum computing.

## Systems Administration 🔧

Systems administration is another of my great passions, and I love working on the management of system infrastructures and networks. I enjoy staying up to date with the latest trends in systems administration and relish the technical challenges this area presents.
P.S.: I'm a Linux enthusiast!

## Space Research 🚀

Another interest of mine is space exploration, and I am fascinated by everything related to space research and technology development. I enjoy learning about space physics, space engineering, and space missions, and I am interested in working on projects related to space research in the future.

## Data Science 📊

Data science is another of my main interests, and I enjoy working with large datasets to find patterns and trends that can aid decision-making. I am particularly interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I like exploring new techniques and tools for data analysis. Although sometimes I hate .csv files! If you know what I mean 😅.

## Current Projects 🚀

Currently, I am involved in some very interesting projects. 
The first is a talk on volunteer computing, where I aim to raise awareness about the importance of voluntarily contributing computing resources to advance research projects in fields such as medicine, astronomy, biology, and physics.
The second is an image classification project still under development ⚠️.
